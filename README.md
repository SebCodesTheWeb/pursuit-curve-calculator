## Hello there!
So I listened to a podcast by 3blue1brown where he interviewed mathematician Steven Strogatz. They briefly talked about one problem that Strogatz was solving when he was young in high school. The four dog pursuit problem.

Four dogs are placed in a square with side length 1. They all run with a speed  of 1 m/s in the direction of next dog clockwise. How long does it take before the dogs reach the center.

I made my own numerical solution to this problem, which I showcase in this video. Where one can adjust some parameters and see how it effects the final answer with some nice animation.
